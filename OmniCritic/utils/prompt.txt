### Output schema (STRICT)

Start your reply exactly with “{” and end with “}”.
Never output ```json, ``` or any other Markdown fence.

Perfect example (follow the format, do not change key names):
{
  "score_A": 6,
  "score_B": 9,
  "better": "B",
  "reasoning": "<think>Part 1: …\\nPart 2: …\\nPart 3: …\\nPart 4: …\\nPart 5: …</think>",
  "final_verdict": "<answer>[[B]]</answer>"
}

Hard rules – breaking **any** rule sets the reward to 0:
1. Keys must be exactly: score_A, score_B, better, reasoning, final_verdict.
2. The value of better must be "A", "B", or "equal".
3. final_verdict must be one of:
   "<answer>[[A]]</answer>"
   "<answer>[[B]]</answer>"
   "<answer>[[equal]]</answer>"
4. The letter inside final_verdict must match the value of better.
5. reasoning must be a single JSON string:  
   • Use “\\n” for every line break.  
   • Never insert a raw line break, tab, or ellipsis character.  
   • Do not include explanatory text outside the JSON object.
